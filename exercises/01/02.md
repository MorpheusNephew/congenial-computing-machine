# Exercise 2

The following program contains several errors:

```c++
*/ Now you should not forget your glasses //
#include <stream>
int main
{
cout << "If this text",
cout >> " appears on your display, ";
cout << " endl;"
cout << 'you can pat yourself on '
<< " the back!" << endl.
return 0;
)
```

Resolve the errors and run the program to test your changes.
